- figure out how to access external endpoints
- figure out biological question.
    What human pathways contain genes associated with Major Depressive Disorder?
- Match wikidata with biological question
- List the Wikidata properties you need for your SPARQL
  SELECT DISTINCT ?geneLabel ?diseaseLabel ?pathwayLabel 
WHERE {
  ?disease	wdt:P2293 ?gene .    # genetic association between disease and gene
  ?disease wdt:P279*  wd:Q42844 .  # limit to major depressive disorder (the * operator runs up a transitive relation..)
  ?pathway wdt:P31 wd:Q4915012 ;
           wdt:P527 ?gene .
  #?gene wdt:P688 ?gene_product .  # gene_product (usually a protein) is a product of a gene (a region of DNA)
  #?drug wdt:P129 ?pathway .
