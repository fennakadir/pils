- Created GitHub account and repository 
- brainstorm and discuss scientific questions 
- Learn how to edit, validate and view HTML pages 
- worked through examples of SPARQL queries 
- experimented with Wikidata SPARQL queries

- figure out how to access external endpoints
- figure out biological question.
    What human pathways contain genes associated with Major Depressive Disorder?
- Match wikidata with biological question
- List the Wikidata properties you need for your SPARQL
  SELECT DISTINCT ?geneLabel ?diseaseLabel ?pathwayLabel 
WHERE {
  ?disease	wdt:P2293 ?gene .    # genetic association between disease and gene
  ?disease wdt:P279*  wd:Q42844 .  # limit to major depressive disorder (the * operator runs up a transitive relation..)
  ?pathway wdt:P31 wd:Q4915012 ;
           wdt:P527 ?gene .
  #?gene wdt:P688 ?gene_product .  # gene_product (usually a protein) is a product of a gene (a region of DNA)
  #?drug wdt:P129 ?pathway .

  - finalize our wikidata query 
 SELECT ?geneLabel ?diseaseLabel ?pathwayLabel ?pathwayID 
 WHERE { ?disease	wdt:P2293 ?gene . 
 ?disease wdt:P279*  wd:Q55950055. 
 ?pathway wdt:P31 wd:Q4915012 ; 
 	wdt:P527 ?gene . 
?pathway wdt:P2410 ?pathwayID 

SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". 
}
- decided to visualize the pathways by accessing the sparql endpoint of wikipathways, and getting the interactions 
and participants of each pathway. wikipathways queries:

- figure out how to link the two queries together in js. The output of the wikidata query (pathway identifiers) are the 
input for the wikipathways query.

- visualize our query data with D3 mobile patent suits
with this we encountered some problems:
	- no directionality 
	- missing components from pathway 
	- only one pathway 
	- elements that interact with themselves, those interactions are not shown 

- trying to change query to also obtain other components pathway 
this was achieved with:
SELECT DISTINCT ?component
WHERE {  VALUES ?pwID {<http://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP1603>}
       ?pathway a wp:Pathway .
       ?pathway dc:identifier ?pwID .
       ?component dcterms:isPartOf ?pathway 
}
however with this query we need to sort the different results into: interaction, source, target, receptor, 
metabolite etc ourselves with javascrip. 
- then we tried out queries that did that function for us. Turned out to be quite difficult. So we are considering making 2 
queries one for the interaction,source and target. With the other one the components (exclusinf interaction, source and target)
are iterated through with javascript and added to the pathway if they are absent. 
We figured out a query that filters out the source, target and interaction from all the components:
SELECT DISTINCT ?component
WHERE {  VALUES ?pwID {<http://identifiers.org/wikipathways/WP1603>}
       ?pathway a wp:Pathway .
       ?pathway dc:identifier ?pwID .
       ?component dcterms:isPartOf ?pathway . 

       MINUS {
       ?component dcterms:isPartOf ?pathway ;
                  a wp:Interaction . 
       }
       MINUS {
       ?component dcterms:isPartOf ?pathway ;
                  wp:source ?source . 
       }
       MINUS {
       ?component dcterms:isPartOf ?pathway ;
                  wp:target ?target . 
       }

}
